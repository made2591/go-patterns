## Creationals
Creational patterns provide ways to instantiate single objects or groups of related objects. There are five such patterns.

### Abstract Factory
The `abstract factory pattern` is a design pattern that allows for the creation of groups of related objects without the requirement of specifying the exact concrete classes that will be used. One of a number of factory classes generates the object sets for you.

The `abstract factory pattern` is used to control class instantiation. More formally, it's usufull to provide a client with a set of related or dependant objects. The *family of objects* created by the factory is determined *at run-time* - at least, not during design - according to the selection of concrete factory class.

#### Example
As an example, consider a program that provide `Vehicles` and `Licenses` to drive them. The system delivers different types of vehicles. Let's suppose there are at least two different types of them: the `car` is a standard car and the respective license to drive the car is of kind `B`. The second type of vehicle provided is the `bus` is a more difficult vehicle to drive and require the driver to own a driver license of type `C`.

In the scenario we described above, there are two types of object required, a `Vehicle` object and a `License` one. With the `abstract factory pattern` we can use two factories to generate these related objects. The `NewCarFactory` may produce vehicles objects of type `car` and licenses objects of type `B`; the `NewBusFactory` creates `bus` vehicles and respective `C`Â licenses.

#### Implementation
Inside the [creationals/abstract-factory](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/tree/master/creationals/abstract-factory) folder there's an implementation of the schema described. In order, we have:

- The [consumer](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/abstract-factory/consumer/consumer.go) package: this represents who will *consume* our factory methods. The consumer class is also created with an interface: this specify two `Get` methods to retrieve a `Vehicle` and a `License` object. The first thing to notice is that the consumer interface doesn't specify which kind of these objects are provided. Actually, the consumer *doesn't know at all* - and it doesn't have to! - about the specific kind of object the factory methods can provide. Since it only knows about `Vechile`s and `License`s, there is a generic interface implemented by all of the `Vehicle` and `License` structs to accomplish this status. In the implementation, the `consumer` struct has two private fields that hold instances of the *abstract* vechiles and licenses. The important thing is that the actual types can remain unknown, as they will only be accessed via their base class interfaces. Thus, when a `Consumer` is instantiated, a concrete factory object is passed to the constructor and used to populate the private fields.
- The [factory](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/abstract-factory/factory/factory.go). This is an interface for the concrete `Factory` structs that will generate new sets of related objects with respective methods. Note that a specific `Factory` method is included for each type of object that will be instantiated. Thus, in this file we can find the interface that define which method a `Factory` struct should implement (the two real constructor `NewVechile` and `NewLicense`), and **two different implementation** of this interface for `Car` and `Bus`. Note that there could be any number of concrete factories depending upon the requirements of the software and this will not change anything of the `Consumer` side -> that it will only be able to create what any implementation of the `Factory` provide.
- The [license](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/abstract-factory/license/license.go) and the [Vehicle](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/abstract-factory/vehicle/vehicle.go) real object that actually implement an interface as well plus an implementation of some constructor-specific method for - respectively - specific kind of vechile and licences.
- The [main](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/abstract-factory/main.go). In the main we can see that by only providing a different `Factory` object, a `Consumer` is able to get the objects it deside without changing anything else and - most important - without knowing anything of the object behind. It can still interact with them through the methods exposed by respective interfaces.

To the test the `abstract factory pattern`:

```
git clone https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/
cd creationals/abstract-factory
go run main.go
```

To run the tests, at the same folder level run:

```
go test -v ./...
```

### Builder
The `builder pattern` is used to control class instantiation. More precisely, it's define to create complex objects with constituent parts that must be created in the same order or using a specific algorithm. An external class, known as the `director`, controls the construction algorithm.

#### Example
Consider a vehicle factory system. It may be that each time a car vehicle is prepared, it can include one or more wheels, one control system, one engine and some additional security feature. The employees working in the factory select the types of action required and the `builder pattern` is used to determine exactly what goes into each vehicle.

Using this model, when the employee selects a "Volkswagen Polo", the building system determines that the vehicle will include a four wheels, one steering wheel, one car engine and two standard airbags. If the customer orders a "Volkswagen Golf", they receive a car made by four special wheels, one steering wheel, one car engine and four special airbags. In each case, the constituent parts are the same and are created in the same order. The final product is quite different.

#### Implementation
Inside the [creationals/builder](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/tree/master/creationals/builder) folder there's an implementation of the schema described. In order, we have:

- The [director](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/builder/director/director.go) package: this represents who will *direct* our building process, by controlling the algorithm that generates the final product object, or the vehicle in this case. In the normal situation, a `director` object is instantiated and its construct method - in this example, `MakeVehicle` method - is called by the user. The method includes a parameter to capture the specific concrete builder object that is to be used to generate the product. The director then calls methods of the concrete builder (see them in a while) in the correct order to generate the product object. On completion of the process, the getProduct method - in this example, `GetVehicle` method - of the builder object can be used to return the product.
- The [builder](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/builder/builder/builder.go) package: this package define both an interface called `Builder` and two different implementation of *different product Builder*s. It defines all of the steps that must be taken in order to correctly create a product. Each step is generally defined in the interface as the actual functionality of the builder is carried out in the concrete implementation. As already said, the `GetVehicle` method is used to return the final product. The concrectes builders that implement this interface are thew `PoloBuilder` and the `GolfBuilder` and both contain the functionality to create a particular complex product.
- The [vehicle](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/builder/vehicle/vehicle.go) package: it contains the type of the complex object that is to be generated by the builder pattern.
- The [main](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/builder/main.go). In the main we can see that by only providing a different `Builder` object, the `Director` is able to order the production of the objects it desires without changing anything else and - most important - without knowing anything of the object behind. It can still interact with them through the methods exposed by respective interfaces.

To the test the `builder pattern`:

```
git clone https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/
cd creationals/builder
go run main.go
```

To run the tests, at the same folder level run:

```
go test -v ./...
```

### Factory
The `factory pattern` is used to control class instantiation. The `factory pattern` is used to replace class constructors, abstracting the process of object generation so that the type of the object instantiated can be determined at run-time.

#### Example
A good example of the use of the factory pattern is when creating a type of vehicle that will be selected by the end-user using a graphical interface. In this case, an *abstract* struct named `Vehicle` - like the one defined for other creational pattern samples - may be created that defines the base functionality of all vehicle. Many concrete structs may be created, perhaps `PoloVehicle`, `GolfVehicle`, etc, each with specific functionality for a different type of vehicle. At run-time, a further struct, perhaps named `VehicleFactory`, generates objects of the correct concrete `Vehicle` struct based upon a parameter passed to the factory method.

#### Implementation
- The [factory](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/factory/factory/factory.go) package: this is an interface for the concrete factory structs that will actually generate new objects. This interface should contain the signature for the factory method. In simple situations the factory method may be implemented directly, rather than being declared as a required method to implement through an interface.
- The [vehicle](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/factory/vehicle/vehicle.go) package: this package define an interface called `Vehicle`. The two different implementation of *different vehicle*s are defined in the [bmw](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/factory/bmw/bmw.go) and [volkswagen](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/factory/volkswagen/volkswagen.go) packages. The `Vehicle` interface defines a couple of methods to set and retrieve specific model type.
- The [bmw](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/factory/bmw/bmw.go)/[volkswagen](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/factory/volkswagen/volkswagen.go) packages: they both contain an implementation of a specific `Vechile` and `Factory` constructor. From both these packages, the only methods that are visible from outside are the `New[Bmw/Volkswagen]Factory`, the respective `CreateVehicle` that can be called over the factory and the methods exposed by the `Vehicle` interface to respect the contract, or `GetModel`, `SetModel` and `PrintDetails`.
- The [main](https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/blob/master/creationals/factory/main.go). In the main we can see that it is possible to create different model of the same vehicle throught respective factory, by passing one parameter to respective `CreateVehicle` method called over the factory implementation. This parameter could have been selected by an external user at run-time. When the object's underlying type is outputted, we can see that the correct car model was selected.

To the test the `factory pattern`:

```
git clone https://github.com/made2591/go-patterns/
cd creationals/factory
go run main.go
```

To run the tests, at the same folder level run:

```
go test -v ./...
```

### Prototype
The `prototype pattern` is used to instantiate a class by copying, or cloning, the properties of an existing object. The new object is an exact copy of the prototype but permits modification without altering the original. This practise is particularly useful when the construction of a brand new object, using the new operator, is inefficient.

When an object is cloned the new object is either a *shallow* or *deep copy*. A shallow copy duplicates all of the object's properties. If any property contains a reference type, the reference is copied. This means that changes to the referenced object are visible in both the clone and the original object. A deep copy clones the main object and all child objects. Any properties of reference types are also cloned, giving a truly independent copy. The prototype pattern usually generates deep copies, though this is dependant upon the situation.
